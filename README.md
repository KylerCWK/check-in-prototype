## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Hugging Face Access Key (for AI features)

### Environment Setup (REQUIRED FIRST)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Set environment variables BEFORE running setup!**

#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
$env:MONGODB_URI = "your_mongodb_connection_string"
$env:HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY = "your_huggingface_api_key"
```

#### Unix/Linux/macOS
```bash
export MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
export HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="your_huggingface_api_key"
```

### Quick Setup (Cross-Platform)

After setting environment variables, run the setup script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KylerCWK/check-in-prototype.git
cd Check-In-Prototype/project

# Run the setup script (validates environment variables)
node setup.js

# Start the application
npm run dev
```

### Manual Setup

**Note: Manual setup still requires environment variables to be set.**

If you prefer to configure the application manually:

1. Create `.env` file in the `server` directory:
```
PORT=5000 {Your Port}
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your-mongo-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

2. Create `.env` file in the `client` directory:
```
VITE_PORT=3000 {Your port}
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts

If you encounter port conflicts, the application will automatically try to use the next available port. You can also set custom ports:
- For the server: Edit `PORT` in `server/.env`
- For the client: Edit `VITE_PORT` in `client/.env`

### API Connection Issues

If the client cannot connect to the API:
1. Check that both client and server are running
2. Verify that the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `client/.env` matches the server's address
3. Check for CORS issues in browser developer console
